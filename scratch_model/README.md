# Scratch Model

The scratch model was primarily made so I could learn the inner workings of a transformer. 
While it is not expected to be the best model, it serves as (1) a learning experience, and
(2) a baseline for future models.

Using tensorflow, we created a 184M parameter transformer model using the question-answer 
dataset generated prior from the website using GPT-4.
