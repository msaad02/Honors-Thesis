# Conversational Chatbot for SUNY Brockport

## Introduction

In this section, provide a brief introduction to your project. Explain why this project is significant and who it's intended for.

---
## Research Question

"What is the most effective methodology for creating a chatbot that can accurately and efficiently provide information on SUNY Brockport-related topics, while ensuring its scope remains limited to the institution?"

---
## Objectives/Goals

- Allow students and faculty to prompt the chatbot, returning information specifically about Brockport. 
- Maintain the chatbot's focus specifically on Brockport related topics, avoiding generic responses.

**Here are some examples of ideal behavior:**

> **Prompt:** How can I apply?  
> **Response:** You can apply to SUNY Brockport many ways, including using the Common Application, or the SUNY Application. Please refer to www2.brockport.edu/admissions/apply for more information!

> **Prompt**: What is the cost of a double room for the Fall 2023 semester?  
> **Response**: The cost of a double room for the Fall 2023 semester is $4,765.

## Methodology

This project entails exploring three different methods to make a chatbot for SUNY Brockport.

1. Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT
2. Fine Tuning available LLMs with contextually relevant conversations
3. Building a model from scratch

Each method will be assessed for its effectiveness in generating accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

---
## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in the three distinct methodologies implemented in this project:

### Data Collection:
- Webscraping
- GPT3.5

### Method 1: Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT
- OpenAI API
- Semantic Search
- Javascript

### Method 2: Fine Tuning available LLMs with contextually relevant conversations
- Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models (LoRA), and qLoRA
- GGML/GPTQ Quantization

### Method 3: Building a model from scratch
- TBD

---
## Technical Details / Timeline

1. Conduct a literature review and analyze similar projects.
2. Define the scope and limitations of the chatbot.
3. Identify appropriate tools, platforms, and resources for chatbot development (e.g., GPT-3, OpenAI's interface, etc.).
4. Determine data requirements and sources for the chatbot (e.g., collaboration with Professor Qawaqneh, Brockport website, external sources, etc.).
5. Select the models to be tested (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Alpaca, LLaMa, self-made model, etc.).
6. Implement transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the chatbot model for the specific use case.
7. Develop a user interface for interacting with the chatbot.
8. Evaluate the chatbot's performance using quantitative metrics (accuracy, response time, etc.).
9. Adjust the chatbot model or data based on evaluation results and iterate until satisfactory
