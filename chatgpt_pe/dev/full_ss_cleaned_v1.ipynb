Usually we can handle them as they come up. There may be times, however, when these problems reach the level of impairing home, family lives, relationships with co-workers, job performance, and a sense of well-being. When this occurs, help is available through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). You and your family members receive free, confidential, and convenient assistance whenever you need it. If you have a problem, the EAP can help!\\nEnjoy this free collection of meditation, sleep, and movement exercises from Headspace.\\nEAP Coordinators\\nSUNY Brockport: Gary Metz\\nSUNY Brockport: Gary Metz\\n350 New Campus Drive\\nBrockport, NY 14420\\n395-5117\\nBrockport employees can contact any New York State EAP coordinator\\nIf you’d like to email one of the coordinators, you can do so at eap@brockport.edu. If you prefer to reach a specific coordinator, please indicate the name in the subject line.\\nWho May Use the EAP?\\nAll employees and retirees of SUNY Brockport and their families, including Brockport Auxiliary Services and Research Foundation.\\nWhy Provide an EAP?\\nFrom time to time, everyone experiences personal problems. Occasionally, it feels like there is no one to turn to, so the situation only gets worse. Without attention, serious consequences may result.\\nOn the other hand, if a persistent personal problem can be identified and action is taken as quickly as possible, chances are good that the difficulty can be managed before it results in a serious deterioration of an employee’s health and/or work performance.\\nWho Makes Referrals?\\nAn employee may contact the EAP on his or her own by just picking up the phone or going to see and EAP coordinator. The service is confidential; coordinators will even arrange to meet the employees away from the workplace to further guarantee confidentiality. Supervisors, union representatives, personnel officers, and friends may also suggest the program.\\nConfidentiality Statement\\nOur program is strictly confidential, a concept we enforce to the utmost. When an employee sees the coordinators, she/he is assured that the information shared will go no further. Only the coordinator is aware of who is accessing the program. Our coordinators must adhere to the Federal Confidentiality Act.\\nNo one will receive reports on the nature of the problem, the type of assistance offered, or even whether the employee contacted a coordinator, unless the employee specifically authorizes it in writing or the coordinator is required to provided such a report by law or executive order.\\nWhat do Coordinators do?\\nEmployee Assistance Program Coordinators are employees who work with SUNY Brockport employees seeking help from the program. They are well trained and experienced for their roles as advisors, consultants, assessors, and links to the best possible resources to solve any problems affecting work performance or overall well-being.\\nPhilosophy\\nThe Employee Assistance Program is dedicated to the health and happiness of employees and their families. The core of the statewide program is based on the belief that an employee is the most valuable resource that a business can have. A troubled employee cannot work to his/her potential nor realize his/her full value. Our goal is to help the troubled employee work towards a solution to the problem, there by returning to the workforce to make a productive contribution, while sparing the needless expense of disciplinary action or possible dismissal.\\nWe a support and self-referral service, based on the concepts of confidentiality, volunteerism, and people caring about people. Our program consists of a joint labor and management committee, representing the ideals of both the unions and management, and a coordinator. The committee oversees the program and coordinator, much like a board of governors, oversees the management of an organization.', metadata={'source': 'https://www2.brockport.edu/support/employee-assistance-program', 'row': 4}),\n",

Therefore, the imperative in advising such students is early enrollment in sequential science courses.\\n- Freshman year enrollment in chemistry, biology, and mathematics courses provides students the necessary background for professional school admission tests and permits enrollment in beneficial subsequent courses before the time admission tests would be taken.\\n- Physics can be taken in the sophomore or junior year. This may make it necessary to postpone completion of general education knowledge area courses until the sophomore or junior academic year.\\nStudents planning to apply for admission to a post-bachelor’s Health Professions program can contact Dr. Logan during their first few weeks on campus so that they can receive timely information and notices of meetings and events for students whose ambition is one of these health professions. Alternatively, students in GEP100 sections that contain Biology, Chemistry, and Biochemistry freshman will receive information about the program there.\\n- Assumes health professional school admission test date and application process at end of 6th semester, but many other options are possible for the timing of application. Please contact Dr. Cook or Dr. Logan if taking both CHM 205 and BIO 201 the first semester of the freshman year could pose a challenge to any individual student, and an alternative schedule is needed.\\nRequired Courses in the Freshman Year\\nNOTE: BIO 201 and BIO 202 are now sequential and must be taken in order.\\nRequired Courses in the Sophomore Year\\n* Courses that also fulfill the requirements for a major in Biology.\\nOther Required Courses\\nEither the PHS 235/240 or the PHS 205/210 course sequence satisfies the admissions requirement for professional health programs and meets the requirements for a major in Biology.\\nFurther Recommendations\\nFor additional information on achieving your professional goals, consult with your biology major advisor and pre-health advisor.', metadata={'source': 'https://www2.brockport.edu/academics/advisement/handbook/pre-health-biology', 'row': 36}),\n",

You also want to be sure all your information is displayed accurately.\\nFind and familiarize yourself with your program catalog.\\nIt describes the graduation requirements for your program. If that program changes while you are enrolled at Brockport, you will be given the option of keeping the requirements in effect at the time of your most recent matriculation or completing the new requirements of the program. If you withdraw from Brockport and are later readmitted, you will be required to follow the program in effect at the time of your readmittance. Also, familiarize yourself with the academic regulations, college policies, resources, and student rights listed on the Student Policies Website.\\nBe sure you understand all program requirements.\\nAll degree program requirements can be found in Degree Works. Be sure to familiarize yourself with Degree Works and communicate with your advisor to ensure that you understand your program requirements. Also, note that some graduate courses may require a prerequisite. At the end of your program, be sure to apply for graduation.\\nUnderstand your grade point average.\\nIf any semester GPA is below 3.0, contact your academic advisor as soon as possible to create a return to good standing plan. There will be a hold that prevents future registration until this plan is approved. NOTE: Before you register for any course, contact financial aid regarding your eligibility.\\nUnderstand how academic credits are earned.\\nA letter grade is given for every course for which a student has registered. At the graduate level, academic credit is earned for grades of “A,” “A-,” “B+,” “B,” “B-,” “C+,” “C,” or “S.” No credit is awarded for grades of “E,” “U” (Unsatisfactory), “I” (Incomplete), “PR” (In Progress), and “AU” (Audit).\\nDon’t wait to repeat courses with an “E” grade.\\nSince the most recent grade replaces the first, repeating immediately is the easiest way to avoid academic probation and raise your GPA. As mentioned before, however, make sure you know the rules regarding repeating a course.\\nUnless otherwise prohibited by departmental policy, students are permitted to repeat courses in which they have earned a grade below “B.” Only the new grade earned during the most recent repeat of a course, whether it is higher, lower, or the same, will be used in computing a student’s cumulative grade point average. All attempted courses and grades remain on the transcript.\\nRepeating a course at another college or university will not remove the previous grade earned at Brockport.\\nCourses may transfer, but grades don’t. Old grades are figured into your GPA. If you want that grade removed, retake the course at Brockport, not at another college.\\nUnderstand the transfer of credits policy.\\nIf you are attempting to transfer credits into your program, please request an official transcript from each institution attended. Instruct institutions to send your transcripts directly to SUNY Brockport, 350 New Campus Dr., Brockport, NY 14420, ATTN: Center for Graduate Studies, Rakov 101. If the institution utilizes an electronic transcript service, send an official transcript to gradappdocs@brockport.edu. Please communicate with the Center for Graduate Studies to be sure your transcripts have been received. Your transfer credits will not be finalized until all transcripts have arrived and been evaluated.\\nWhen dropping from full-time to part-time status, remember to consider implications for your financial aid.\\nA graduate student at SUNY Brockport has full-time status for Enrollment Verification purposes when: enrolled for at least 9 graduate credits per semester and/or registered for thesis credit(s).\\nRequest a Temporary Academic Leave if needed.\\nStudents whose progress toward degree completion is interrupted by circumstances beyond their control may apply for leave up to three consecutive semesters (fall, spring, and summer). Application for such a leave is made to the student’s department. Leaves of absence approved by the department will not be charged against either the continuous enrollment or time to degree completion Brockport graduate policies.\\nKnow that if you leave the college for an extended period of time, your requirements may not be the same when you return.\\nUnder a Leave of Absence, students are allowed three semesters to earn no credit in which they are still an active student; if you do not return in or by the fourth semester, you are made Inactive. If you wish to return after that fourth semester has lapsed, you will need to submit a Request for Reinstatement. Please note that your requirements will be those in place at the time you return, NOT at the time you left. If you are planning to separate from the College, whether temporarily or permanently, familiarize yourself with the Leave of Absence/Separation policy.\\nDo not drop a course without formally notifying the Office of Registration and Records.\\nIf you simply stop attending a course without formally dropping it, you will likely end up with a failing grade and a bill.\\nContact the Financial Aid Office if you have questions about your credit load.\\nFull-time graduate student enrollment for tuition and federal financial aid purposes begins at 9 graduate credits per semester. Graduate student eligibility for federal student loans begins at 6 graduate credits per semester.\\nUse the Hazen Center for Integrated Care if needed!\\nIf you are struggling physically, mentally, or emotionally, don’t hesitate to seek out help at the Health Center, Counseling Center, or any other resource available through Hazen. Hazen is available to any registered SUNY Brockport student.\\nMore information is available on Current Student FAQs.', metadata={'source': 'https://www2.brockport.edu/graduate/graduate-student-guide', 'row': 74}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='url: https://www2.brockport.edu/academics/advisement/handbook/grading-system\\ndata: SUNY Brockport uses the grading system found in many colleges and universities, awarding a letter grade of “A” through “E” to indicate the level of accomplishment in each course for which a student is registered. Each of these letters carries quality points, which are the basis for computing the semester index and cumulative index, often referred to as grade point average (GPA). The letter grades and their associated quality points are as follows:\\nQuality points are awarded for each credit of work taken. A three-credit course in which a letter grade of an “A” is received earns twelve quality points (3 credits x 4 quality points).\\nWhen calculating GPA, keep two things in mind. First, when courses are taken on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis they do not affect the index at all, because they carry no quality points. Second, both semester and cumulative index at SUNY Brockport are based solely on work at this institution. Credits earned at other accredited institutions are frequently transferable to Brockport and may count toward the degree, but they do not have any effect on the GPA.\\nTo Calculate GPA\\nAny course taken at Brockport on the “letter grade” option contributes to the semester/cumulative index.\\nThe only exception to this is the course that is repeated, in which case the last grade earned is the one that contributes to the index. (All courses taken remain on the transcript, however, whether repeated or not.) For easy and efficient calculation of the GPA, access the GPA Calculator.\\nWith these grades for a semester, a student would earn a semester index of 2.12, which is the result of dividing the total number of quality points earned (34) by the number of credits completed (16), to attain the average quality points per credit. To figure a cumulative index, follow the same process for all courses taken at Brockport.To be absolutely certain, consult with the Office of Registration and Records, which enters the index on official student transcripts each semester.\\nPredicting the Future\\nAn advisor may want to help a student figure out what s/he may need to achieve a certain index. Let’s say the student wants to reach a cumulative index of 3.0 by the end of the next semester and has a 2.8 based on 40 credits right now. If the student plans to take 15 credits next semester, s/he is going to have to end up with an average of three quality points for every one of those 55 credits, or a total of 165. Right? And right now s/he has 112 (40 credits x 2.8). That means the student needs to accumulate 53 more with those 15 credits. That means s/he has to manage a 3.53 (53 divided by 15). Maybe s/he’ll decide to get there in two semesters, or maybe s/he’ll decide s/he can really pull off that 3.53. But that’s the way to figure it out.\\nMidterm Grades\\nInstructors in each class will provide mid-semester grades. These grades should reflect progress toward the completion of the course requirements, and serve as an evaluation of the quality of work to date. Mid-term grades are simply a progress report—they do not become a part of the student’s permanent record.', metadata={'source': 'https://www2.brockport.edu/academics/advisement/handbook/grading-system', 'row': 87}),\n",

This interdisciplinary program incorporates courses from the Departments of Anthropology and Criminal Justice.\\nThe unique focus of the program is the integration of a “step-into-their-shoes” anthropological approach to the criminological pursuit of justice. It focuses on educating students about how societal systems interact with personal histories to create different realities for different people. This multi-level understanding is key for students interested in cultivating careers in advocacy and human rights, the legal or law enforcement fields, humanitarian and community workers, and forensic specialists.\\n-\\nAdmission Requirements\\nWe recommend submitting first-year applications in October or early November. We decide your admission once you complete your application.\\nNext Deadline for Transfer Students\\nFall Semester: August 1Undergraduate Admissions\\n-\\nFirst in the Nation\\nOur innovative community justice program is the first of its kind in our nation. It offers a unique pairing between our Department of Criminal Justice and Department of Anthropology.\\nRecent events across our nation underscore the importance of social justice and the need to transform our existing societal institutions and systems. Our program offers an alternative approach for students interested in criminology. Our approach emphasizes theoretical considerations of power and an applied toolkit for understanding and connecting to people from diverse backgrounds.\\n-\\nCareer Outlook\\nCurrently, there is a need for advocates, law enforcement, legal professionals, and community service managers, who understand the intersections of race, class, and history. This demand will only increase in the future as people-facing professionals contend with the marginalization of our society’s vulnerable populations and seek to improve society.\\nPopular careers that majors could pursue include, but are not limited to:\\n- Community Service Manager\\n- Mediator or Arbitrator\\n- Emergency Management Director\\n- Health Advocate\\n- Nonprofit Project Coordinator\\n- Environmental Justice Lawyer,\\nWhat’s Next?\\nFind Out More\\nGet personalized information about your area of interest.Request Info\\nCome for a Visit\\nWe offer tours all year long, but February and March are our busiest months.Schedule a Visit\\nStart Your Application\\nReady to start your application?

This option is intended to accommodate the interests of students whose academic goals would not be met by an existing academic major, a double major, a major-minor combination or electives. The CLAM is a variation from a registered major, called hereafter the primary discipline, and not an opportunity to create an entirely new major.\\nThe CLAM option is open to all students in good academic standing at the University. Students who wish to exercise this option seek appropriate faculty advisement, and the program that is proposed by the student and by the divisional dean becomes a contract between the student and SUNY Brockport. Revision may be accomplished through the same procedure used in seeking initial approval.\\nThe title of CLAM, which must be distinct from that of any established major, is the title that will identify the student’s major on the student’s final transcript.\\nProcedures\\n- The student obtains all necessary CLAM forms and information from the Office of Academic Advisement.\\n- The student identifies two advisors who are appropriate representatives of the disciplinary dimensions of the intended CLAM and obtains their signatures on the Declaration of Intent to Develop a CLAM form.\\n- The student, who has primary responsibility, and the advisors work together to design the CLAM.\\n- When the design of the CLAM is complete on the CLAM form, the student and both advisors sign the form.\\nCLAM proposals should be submitted during the student’s third or fourth semester.

These pages should help you better navigate the process at Brockport.\\n- Transfer EOP students must have been EOP/HEOP, SEEK, or College Discovery Program at their previous or current college. If you are an applicant who was previously in one of these programs and looking to be considered EOP at Brockport, you must check the EOP question on the SUNY or Common Application and submit the EOP Certificate of Eligibility Form.\\nThe Application Process\\nThe EOP application process is a very detailed one, and we encourage applicants to stay abreast of what the University is requesting at all times.\\nPhase 1: Academic Eligibility\\nApplicants to the program will be reviewed to determine if they are academically eligible. Meeting our minimum academic requirements allows you to be considered for further review. This does not, however, guarantee automatic eligibility for the program.\\nApplicants also need to complete the EOP Financial Eligibility process. An incomplete or unsubmitted form will delay the process.\\nPhase 2: Financial Eligibility\\nThis phase determines the applicant’s financial eligibility by taking into account the income received by each household member. Learn more about the Financial Review Process.\\nPlease submit the EOP Financial Form using the appropriate application link:\\nEOP Form for SUNY Application Users EOP Form for Common Application Users\\nWe have a limited number of seats for the program and review thousands of applications yearly; therefore, it is not possible to admit every single student into this program. Students who are accepted are encouraged to submit their deposit by the May 1 deadline. Once the program is filled, a waitlist will be created. To be placed on the waitlist, you will need to submit a deposit. That deposit will not be posted unless you are officially placed in the program. If we are unable to offer you a place in the program, your deposit will be refunded to you after the summer program begins.\\nRequired Documents\\nIn order for a final decision to be made on your application, you must submit ALL requested information. Documents can be faxed to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. They will be used to process your application. The name of the applicant should be written on ALL documents that are submitted.\\nDocuments requested may include:\\n- Parent 1040 (federal tax return), with signature on the second page\\n- Parent copy of all W-2s\\n- Copy of all 1099s\\n- Copy of Schedule C\\nSend a copy of your FAFSA\\n- Our office MUST receive a copy of your FAFSA in order to begin your financial review.\\n- It is also important to release your information to SUNY Brockport.\\nCheck Application Status\\nCheck your status online at least two times per week.\\n- A status that was “complete and ready for review” more than likely could change to “incomplete” if we determine that additional documentation is needed.\\n- If you are uncertain about the information requested, please contact us.\\nAssistance for Applicants\\nWe know that the process of applying to the program can be stressful. Please rest assured that we are here to help. Our expert EOP admissions advisors are here to assist you throughout the process and ensure that you submit the proper documentation.

In recent years, professional schools’ admission policies have broadened in such a way as to encourage students from all disciplines to consider one of the health professions as a career, so long as they have demonstrated strong performance in the required prerequisite courses. For example, there have been increasing numbers of Brockport students majoring in Psychology and Exercise Science pursuing the health professions.\\nStudents who expect to enroll in a health professional school in the fall semester following graduation after eight semesters of undergraduate work must plan to take the relevant admission test in spring semester of their junior year or the following summer. Therefore, the imperative in advising such students is early enrollment in sequential science courses.\\n- Freshman year enrollment in chemistry, biology, and mathematics courses provides students the necessary background for professional school admission tests and permits enrollment in beneficial subsequent courses before the time admission tests would be taken.\\n- Physics can be taken in the sophomore or junior year. This may make it necessary to postpone completion of general education knowledge area courses until the sophomore or junior academic year.\\nStudents planning to apply for admission to a post-bachelor’s Health Professions program can contact Dr. Logan during their first few weeks on campus so that they can receive timely information and notices of meetings and events for students whose ambition is one of these health professions.\\n- Assumes health professional school admission test date and application process at end of 6th semester, but many other options are possible for the timing of application.

       " Document(page_content='url: https://www2.brockport.edu/about/strategic-plan\\ndata: Building a Better Brockport takes the concerted effort of all of our community: our students, faculty, staff, and administrators. Our commitment to continuous improvement is evident in all that we seek to achieve and in the ways that we support our students’ learning; our employees’ development and career paths; and our community’s needs. As a regional comprehensive University, we recognize our role as a value-added institution and as a steward of place.\\nThe development of the first iteration of Building a Better Brockport (2017-2022) included vision cafes, discussions and review with the University Leadership summit, town halls, and surveys. The Strategic Planning Committee worked to refine our mission and our Brockport Promise, to create a vision, and to develop the four values of community, engagement, excellence and transformation. The four goals of our 2017-22 strategic plan led to 33 measures of success, reviewed annually by Goal Groups, the Joint Planning and Budget Committee, and Cabinet. Each year, as we reviewed the work of the past year, we made changes as required, and continually focused on our goals of being an ever better University community. We updated the operational plan each year, and published an Annual Report that focused on our progress. Building a Better Brockport 2022-27 builds on this work.\\nOver the last six and a half years, I have seen our community evolve, embrace change, focus on challenging societal issues, and cope with remarkable resilience during the COVID-19 world-wide pandemic. What this has taught us is that while we cannot predict all that the future will hold, we can be alert to opportunity, and understand our role as a value-added institution. We can be cognizant of programs, plans and policies that assumed an identity-neutral stance, and work towards better understanding how our individual and collective identities impact our ability to benefit from such programs. We have become wiser about our assessment methods and about how we track outcomes. We focus on continuous improvement and know that we will always be building towards a better Brockport.\\nWe are proudly part of the SUNY system. As SUNY changes, so do we change, though we stay true to our goals, our mission, our vision and our promise.\\nI want to thank the current Strategic Planning Committee\\n[1]\\nfor their hard work in consulting widely, listening to feedback, and revising the 2017-2022 plan with such diligence and care. We have adjusted our four goals, reduced our measures of success to 18, and, based on the overwhelming support by our community, added the value of Inclusion to our four existing values. We also simplified the language of the values.\\nWe present to you our collective efforts in Building a Better Brockport 2022-27.\\nPresident Heidi Macpherson\\nSUNY Brockport\\nMarch 2022\\n[1]\\nDamita Davis, Keith Davis, Linda Delene, Debbie Eggebrecht, Dan Goebel, Jenny Green, Mehruz Kamal, John Keiser, Sara Kelly, Darson Rhodes, Taneika Thompson, and Jim Zollweg.

In recent years, professional schools’ admission policies have broadened in such a way as to encourage students from all disciplines to consider one of the health professions as a career, so long as they have demonstrated strong performance in the required prerequisite courses. For example, there have been increasing numbers of Brockport students majoring in Psychology and Exercise Science pursuing the health professions.\\nStudents who expect to enroll in a health professional school in the fall semester following graduation after eight semesters of undergraduate work must plan to take the relevant admission test in spring semester of their junior year or the following summer. Therefore, the imperative in advising such students is early enrollment in sequential science courses.\\n- Freshman year enrollment in chemistry, biology, and mathematics courses provides students the necessary background for professional school admission tests and permits enrollment in beneficial subsequent courses before the time admission tests would be taken.\\n- Physics can be taken in the sophomore or junior year.

       " Document(page_content='url: https://www2.brockport.edu/academics/advisement/handbook/pre-law\\ndata: Pre-Law\\nThe Undergraduate Program\\nThe pre-law program at SUNY Brockport is not a degree-granting major. We have made a conscious decision not to institute a major in pre-law for several reasons. The most important is that in our discussions with Deans of Admissions from various law schools we have learned that law schools do not want students to major in pre- law. Not unreasonably, law schools believe that teaching students about the law is a job best done by the law schools themselves. What law schools do want is for student to major in fields that stress reading comprehension, analytical skills, logic, critical thinking, and writing and oral communication. Nearly every major at SUNY Brockport will provide exactly that kind of instruction. In addition, SUNY Brockport believes that you should have the flexibility of choosing any major that excites you as you prepare for law school. Students perform better when they major in fields that interest them and maintaining a high grade point average is key to getting into the law school of your choice.\\nWhat the pre-law program at SUNY Brockport does is introduce students to law, the legal profession, and help develop key foundation skills, enabling them to make a more informed choice about a legal career. In addition, the program helps students prepare so they have a better chance of being accepted into law school and of succeeding in their legal studies and career.\\nRecommended Courses\\n- PLS 320 Introduction to Legal Studies\\n- PLS 324 Constitutional Law I\\n- PLS 326 Constitutional Law II\\n- PLS 320 Law and Legal Process\\n- PLS 490 Moot Court Seminar\\n- CRJ 305 Adjudication Process\\n- CRJ 311 Criminal Law\\n- CRJ 455 Legal Traditions\\n- CRJ 475 Legal and Justice Research Methods\\n- CRJ 495 Law and Evidence\\n- BUS 375 Business Law I\\n- BUS 376 Business Law II\\n- ENL 305 Advanced Composition\\n- PHL 104 Critical Thinking\\n- PHL 202 Logic (This class will help sharpen critical thinking and writing skills, which are essential for law students and lawyers)\\nLegal Internship: Every student in the pre-law program will participate in a legal internship program. This experiential requirement is designed to insure that students gain insights into the practice of law. Before committing yourself to law school you should have a realistic understanding of the requirements of a legal practice.\\nCo-curriculum Activities\\nSUNY Brockport negotiated a special reduced-cost fee with Kaplan for our students. In addition, the Provost and Dean of Letters and Sciences have each agreed to rebate $100 dollars to students who take the Kaplan class and meet certain requirements. This campus-wide effort to ensure that students are able to afford preparatory classes is evidence of the deep commitment of SUNY Brockport to insure that those of our students who wish to go to law school are able to do so.\\nLaw Related Social Activities\\nThe pre-law social activities include events such as our annual Law Day celebration. Although events vary from year to year, a typical Law Day includes visits from Brockport alumni who are currently practicing attorneys and others who are in law school. We have also had panels with Deans of admissions from various law schools and representatives from the many law offices where we place interns. Other social activities include our new “Court TV in the Dorms” nights in which professors and students get together to view an episode of Court TV and discuss the proceedings. We also have an active pre-law club run by students.\\nCampus Pre-Law Advisor\\nSUNY Brockport has a campus Pre-Law Advisor who will be available to assist you throughout your entire undergraduate experience. If you plan to visit school and would like to set up a meeting with the pre law advisor send an email to Dr. Chadsey at mchadsey@brockport.edu, or contact me at (585) 395-2320. Check out our pre- law web site here.You should feel very confident that in choosing SUNY Brockport you are selecting a university that will do an exceptional job of preparing you for law school.', metadata={'source': 'https://www2.brockport.edu/academics/advisement/handbook/pre-law', 'row': 261}),\n",

Meeting our minimum academic requirements allows you to be considered for further review. This does not, however, guarantee automatic eligibility for the program.\\nApplicants also need to complete the EOP Financial Eligibility process.

Please rest assured that we are here to help. Our expert EOP admissions advisors are here to assist you throughout the process and ensure that you submit the proper documentation. However, we will also rely on you to submit the required documents in a timely manner.\\nPlease note that the EOP office will be an active part of this process, and you may be contacted by counselors regarding documents you are missing.

Poster presentations from the event have the chance to be recognized in the Spectrum, our online journal which celebrates faculty-nominated and peer-reviewed student research.”\\nScholars Day has several pursuits:\\n- To publicize research\\n- To share new concepts and ideas\\n- To expand knowledge\\n- To provide an opportunity to socialize with other members of the campus community outside of one’s own department or discipline\\n2023 Scholars Day\\nThis year’s 39th annual Scholars Day event will focus on the idea of sustainability. While it is not mandatory for all presentations to include concepts on this theme, we encourage all presenters, students, faculty, and staff to incorporate their perception of what sustainability means through the lens of their discipline and research. It is evident that the theme of sustainability will look different across departments, which supports the notion that not just one group of individuals can solve the major global crisis of living a more sustainable life. For this reason, we welcome the opportunity to present your unique relationship to this topic through the lens of your discipline and scholarly activity.\\nNote: All presentations and poster presentations do not have to incorporate this theme as we understand this might not be applicable for all, and we strongly encourage all presentations to be involved in this incredible event to showcase our campus community’s research and scholarly activity.\\nScholars Day presentations begin at 9 am and continue until 5 pm on the main Brockport campus. Classes are suspended during this time so that the entire campus community can participate. There are two special evening sessions offered this year as well.', metadata={'source': 'https://www2.brockport.edu/academics/scholars-day', 'row': 286}),\n",

There may be times, however, when these problems reach the level of impairing home, family lives, relationships with co-workers, job performance, and a sense of well-being. When this occurs, help is available through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). You and your family members receive free, confidential, and convenient assistance whenever you need it.

Occasionally, it feels like there is no one to turn to, so the situation only gets worse. Without attention, serious consequences may result.\\nOn the other hand, if a persistent personal problem can be identified and action is taken as quickly as possible, chances are good that the difficulty can be managed before it results in a serious deterioration of an employee’s health and/or work performance.\\nWho Makes Referrals?\\nAn employee may contact the EAP on his or her own by just picking up the phone or going to see and EAP coordinator. The service is confidential; coordinators will even arrange to meet the employees away from the workplace to further guarantee confidentiality. Supervisors, union representatives, personnel officers, and friends may also suggest the program.\\nConfidentiality Statement\\nOur program is strictly confidential, a concept we enforce to the utmost. When an employee sees the coordinators, she/he is assured that the information shared will go no further. Only the coordinator is aware of who is accessing the program. Our coordinators must adhere to the Federal Confidentiality Act.\\nNo one will receive reports on the nature of the problem, the type of assistance offered, or even whether the employee contacted a coordinator, unless the employee specifically authorizes it in writing or the coordinator is required to provided such a report by law or executive order.\\nWhat do Coordinators do?\\nEmployee Assistance Program Coordinators are employees who work with SUNY Brockport employees seeking help from the program. They are well trained and experienced for their roles as advisors, consultants, assessors, and links to the best possible resources to solve any problems affecting work performance or overall well-being.\\nPhilosophy\\nThe Employee Assistance Program is dedicated to the health and happiness of employees and their families. The core of the statewide program is based on the belief that an employee is the most valuable resource that a business can have. A troubled employee cannot work to his/her potential nor realize his/her full value. Our goal is to help the troubled employee work towards a solution to the problem, there by returning to the workforce to make a productive contribution, while sparing the needless expense of disciplinary action or possible dismissal.\\nWe a support and self-referral service, based on the concepts of confidentiality, volunteerism, and people caring about people. Our program consists of a joint labor and management committee, representing the ideals of both the unions and management, and a coordinator.

We address these within the anthropological subfields of archaeology, cultural anthropology, and biological anthropology. Students benefit from small classes in upper division majors’ courses, with faculty in the classroom, lab and field, and a broad range of course offerings.\\nThe Anthropology Major and Minor provide excellent preparation for postgraduate training and/or careers in applied anthropology, museum work, public and contractual archaeology, education, forensic science, law, health/medicine, international business, marketing, human services, tourism and other fields that require an understanding of human diversity and adaptability.\\nThe Anthropology Major consists of a 36 credit core that allows students to augment their education with a dual major or minor in another field applicable to their goals and needs.

A minimum of 6 credits must be at the 400 level.\\nAuxiliary Courses\\nWe suggest that all Majors complete a cultural or archaeological field school, semester-abroad program or internship (ANT 462 or BCE 322) depending on their anthropological interests. In addition we recommend that students take courses in foreign language (two semesters), statistics, computer applications, and advanced writing depending on their career goals. Courses ancillary to anthropology may be suggested by the advisor if these are relevant to career or graduate school goals. For example, anthropology majors intending to pursue careers and/or graduate work in areas such as museum work, biological anthropology, archaeology, conservancy/conservation, medicine, and law may be advised to take additional courses in disciplinary areas relevant to their career goals.\\nMajors may increase their chances for a successful career by:\\n- Combining anthropology with a professional or pre-professional program such as teacher certification, pre-law, or pre-medical;\\n- Completing a minor or second major in a field that complements anthropology (art, communications, psychology, biology, environmental sciences, etc.)\\n- Developing skills in areas outside of, but relevant to, anthropology, such as computer science, foreign languages, technical writing or advanced composition\\n- Completing an internship, field project or service position in an area relevant to anthropology\\n- Experiencing another culture through a credit-bearing semester abroad', metadata={'source': 'https://www2.brockport.edu/academics/advisement/handbook/anthropology-major', 'row': 66}),\n",

Make note of your advisor’s name and contact information so that you may contact them when you have questions. It is courteous to give your advisor ample time (at least 48 hours) to respond to your inquiry.\\nCommunicate with your advisor to get your advisement key to register for classes.\\nEvery semester, faculty will provide their graduate student advisees with an “advisement key number”, which students need to be able to register for classes in their fall and spring semesters.\\nMeet with your advisor to create your plan of study.\\nBy the end of their first semester in matriculated status, graduate students are encouraged to meet with their faculty advisor to determine their plan of study. While students’ plans of study are evident in their electronic Degree Audit (Degree Works), some academic departments require students, by the end of their first semester, to work with faculty advisors to draft a printed plan of study.\\nDon’t just assume your degree audit is accurate; read it critically!\\nNever assume that your degree audit report is always accurate. Read it carefully and discuss any questions with your advisor or the Center for Graduate Studies. Course substitutions and waivers must be entered manually and need to be reflected on the Degree Audit report. You also want to be sure all your information is displayed accurately.\\nFind and familiarize yourself with your program catalog.\\nIt describes the graduation requirements for your program. If that program changes while you are enrolled at Brockport, you will be given the option of keeping the requirements in effect at the time of your most recent matriculation or completing the new requirements of the program. If you withdraw from Brockport and are later readmitted, you will be required to follow the program in effect at the time of your readmittance. Also, familiarize yourself with the academic regulations, college policies, resources, and student rights listed on the Student Policies Website.\\nBe sure you understand all program requirements.\\nAll degree program requirements can be found in Degree Works. Be sure to familiarize yourself with Degree Works and communicate with your advisor to ensure that you understand your program requirements. Also, note that some graduate courses may require a prerequisite. At the end of your program, be sure to apply for graduation.\\nUnderstand your grade point average.\\nIf any semester GPA is below 3.0, contact your academic advisor as soon as possible to create a return to good standing plan. There will be a hold that prevents future registration until this plan is approved. NOTE: Before you register for any course, contact financial aid regarding your eligibility.\\nUnderstand how academic credits are earned.\\nA letter grade is given for every course for which a student has registered. At the graduate level, academic credit is earned for grades of “A,” “A-,” “B+,” “B,” “B-,” “C+,” “C,” or “S.” No credit is awarded for grades of “E,” “U” (Unsatisfactory), “I” (Incomplete), “PR” (In Progress), and “AU” (Audit).\\nDon’t wait to repeat courses with an “E” grade.\\nSince the most recent grade replaces the first, repeating immediately is the easiest way to avoid academic probation and raise your GPA. As mentioned before, however, make sure you know the rules regarding repeating a course.\\nUnless otherwise prohibited by departmental policy, students are permitted to repeat courses in which they have earned a grade below “B.” Only the new grade earned during the most recent repeat of a course, whether it is higher, lower, or the same, will be used in computing a student’s cumulative grade point average. All attempted courses and grades remain on the transcript.\\nRepeating a course at another college or university will not remove the previous grade earned at Brockport.\\nCourses may transfer, but grades don’t. Old grades are figured into your GPA. If you want that grade removed, retake the course at Brockport, not at another college.\\nUnderstand the transfer of credits policy.\\nIf you are attempting to transfer credits into your program, please request an official transcript from each institution attended. Instruct institutions to send your transcripts directly to SUNY Brockport, 350 New Campus Dr., Brockport, NY 14420, ATTN: Center for Graduate Studies, Rakov 101. If the institution utilizes an electronic transcript service, send an official transcript to gradappdocs@brockport.edu. Please communicate with the Center for Graduate Studies to be sure your transcripts have been received. Your transfer credits will not be finalized until all transcripts have arrived and been evaluated.\\nWhen dropping from full-time to part-time status, remember to consider implications for your financial aid.\\nA graduate student at SUNY Brockport has full-time status for Enrollment Verification purposes when: enrolled for at least 9 graduate credits per semester and/or registered for thesis credit(s).\\nRequest a Temporary Academic Leave if needed.\\nStudents whose progress toward degree completion is interrupted by circumstances beyond their control may apply for leave up to three consecutive semesters (fall, spring, and summer). Application for such a leave is made to the student’s department. Leaves of absence approved by the department will not be charged against either the continuous enrollment or time to degree completion Brockport graduate policies.\\nKnow that if you leave the college for an extended period of time, your requirements may not be the same when you return.\\nUnder a Leave of Absence, students are allowed three semesters to earn no credit in which they are still an active student; if you do not return in or by the fourth semester, you are made Inactive. If you wish to return after that fourth semester has lapsed, you will need to submit a Request for Reinstatement. Please note that your requirements will be those in place at the time you return, NOT at the time you left. If you are planning to separate from the College, whether temporarily or permanently, familiarize yourself with the Leave of Absence/Separation policy.\\nDo not drop a course without formally notifying the Office of Registration and Records.\\nIf you simply stop attending a course without formally dropping it, you will likely end up with a failing grade and a bill.\\nContact the Financial Aid Office if you have questions about your credit load.\\nFull-time graduate student enrollment for tuition and federal financial aid purposes begins at 9 graduate credits per semester. Graduate student eligibility for federal student loans begins at 6 graduate credits per semester.\\nUse the Hazen Center for Integrated Care if needed!\\nIf you are struggling physically, mentally, or emotionally, don’t hesitate to seek out help at the Health Center, Counseling Center, or any other resource available through Hazen.

       " Document(page_content='url: https://www2.brockport.edu/academics/advisement/handbook/grading-system\\ndata: SUNY Brockport uses the grading system found in many colleges and universities, awarding a letter grade of “A” through “E” to indicate the level of accomplishment in each course for which a student is registered. Each of these letters carries quality points, which are the basis for computing the semester index and cumulative index, often referred to as grade point average (GPA). The letter grades and their associated quality points are as follows:\\nQuality points are awarded for each credit of work taken. A three-credit course in which a letter grade of an “A” is received earns twelve quality points (3 credits x 4 quality points).\\nWhen calculating GPA, keep two things in mind. First, when courses are taken on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis they do not affect the index at all, because they carry no quality points. Second, both semester and cumulative index at SUNY Brockport are based solely on work at this institution. Credits earned at other accredited institutions are frequently transferable to Brockport and may count toward the degree, but they do not have any effect on the GPA.\\nTo Calculate GPA\\nAny course taken at Brockport on the “letter grade” option contributes to the semester/cumulative index.\\nThe only exception to this is the course that is repeated, in which case the last grade earned is the one that contributes to the index. (All courses taken remain on the transcript, however, whether repeated or not.) For easy and efficient calculation of the GPA, access the GPA Calculator.\\nWith these grades for a semester, a student would earn a semester index of 2.12, which is the result of dividing the total number of quality points earned (34) by the number of credits completed (16), to attain the average quality points per credit. To figure a cumulative index, follow the same process for all courses taken at Brockport.To be absolutely certain, consult with the Office of Registration and Records, which enters the index on official student transcripts each semester.\\nPredicting the Future\\nAn advisor may want to help a student figure out what s/he may need to achieve a certain index. Let’s say the student wants to reach a cumulative index of 3.0 by the end of the next semester and has a 2.8 based on 40 credits right now. If the student plans to take 15 credits next semester, s/he is going to have to end up with an average of three quality points for every one of those 55 credits, or a total of 165. Right? And right now s/he has 112 (40 credits x 2.8). That means the student needs to accumulate 53 more with those 15 credits. That means s/he has to manage a 3.53 (53 divided by 15). Maybe s/he’ll decide to get there in two semesters, or maybe s/he’ll decide s/he can really pull off that 3.53. But that’s the way to figure it out.\\nMidterm Grades\\nInstructors in each class will provide mid-semester grades. These grades should reflect progress toward the completion of the course requirements, and serve as an evaluation of the quality of work to date. Mid-term grades are simply a progress report—they do not become a part of the student’s permanent record.', metadata={'source': 'https://www2.brockport.edu/academics/advisement/handbook/grading-system', 'row': 87}),\n",

This interdisciplinary program incorporates courses from the Departments of Anthropology and Criminal Justice.\\nThe unique focus of the program is the integration of a “step-into-their-shoes” anthropological approach to the criminological pursuit of justice. It focuses on educating students about how societal systems interact with personal histories to create different realities for different people. This multi-level understanding is key for students interested in cultivating careers in advocacy and human rights, the legal or law enforcement fields, humanitarian and community workers, and forensic specialists.\\n-\\nAdmission Requirements\\nWe recommend submitting first-year applications in October or early November.

Our program offers an alternative approach for students interested in criminology. Our approach emphasizes theoretical considerations of power and an applied toolkit for understanding and connecting to people from diverse backgrounds.\\n-\\nCareer Outlook\\nCurrently, there is a need for advocates, law enforcement, legal professionals, and community service managers, who understand the intersections of race, class, and history. This demand will only increase in the future as people-facing professionals contend with the marginalization of our society’s vulnerable populations and seek to improve society.\\nPopular careers that majors could pursue include, but are not limited to:\\n- Community Service Manager\\n- Mediator or Arbitrator\\n- Emergency Management Director\\n- Health Advocate\\n- Nonprofit Project Coordinator\\n- Environmental Justice Lawyer,\\nWhat’s Next?\\nFind Out More\\nGet personalized information about your area of interest.Request Info\\nCome for a Visit\\nWe offer tours all year long, but February and March are our busiest months.Schedule a Visit\\nStart Your Application\\nReady to start your application?

This option is intended to accommodate the interests of students whose academic goals would not be met by an existing academic major, a double major, a major-minor combination or electives. The CLAM is a variation from a registered major, called hereafter the primary discipline, and not an opportunity to create an entirely new major.\\nThe CLAM option is open to all students in good academic standing at the University. Students who wish to exercise this option seek appropriate faculty advisement, and the program that is proposed by the student and by the divisional dean becomes a contract between the student and SUNY Brockport. Revision may be accomplished through the same procedure used in seeking initial approval.\\nThe title of CLAM, which must be distinct from that of any established major, is the title that will identify the student’s major on the student’s final transcript.\\nProcedures\\n- The student obtains all necessary CLAM forms and information from the Office of Academic Advisement.\\n- The student identifies two advisors who are appropriate representatives of the disciplinary dimensions of the intended CLAM and obtains their signatures on the Declaration of Intent to Develop a CLAM form.\\n- The student, who has primary responsibility, and the advisors work together to design the CLAM.\\n- When the design of the CLAM is complete on the CLAM form, the student and both advisors sign the form.\\nCLAM proposals should be submitted during the student’s third or fourth semester. Those submitted by October 1 will be processed by the end of the fall semester; those submitted by March 1 will be processed by the end of the spring semester.\\nA program will not be considered in which more than two-thirds of the courses in the CLAM have been completed before the proposal is submitted.

       " Document(page_content='url: https://www2.brockport.edu/about/strategic-plan\\ndata: Building a Better Brockport takes the concerted effort of all of our community: our students, faculty, staff, and administrators. Our commitment to continuous improvement is evident in all that we seek to achieve and in the ways that we support our students’ learning; our employees’ development and career paths; and our community’s needs. As a regional comprehensive University, we recognize our role as a value-added institution and as a steward of place.\\nThe development of the first iteration of Building a Better Brockport (2017-2022) included vision cafes, discussions and review with the University Leadership summit, town halls, and surveys. The Strategic Planning Committee worked to refine our mission and our Brockport Promise, to create a vision, and to develop the four values of community, engagement, excellence and transformation. The four goals of our 2017-22 strategic plan led to 33 measures of success, reviewed annually by Goal Groups, the Joint Planning and Budget Committee, and Cabinet. Each year, as we reviewed the work of the past year, we made changes as required, and continually focused on our goals of being an ever better University community. We updated the operational plan each year, and published an Annual Report that focused on our progress. Building a Better Brockport 2022-27 builds on this work.\\nOver the last six and a half years, I have seen our community evolve, embrace change, focus on challenging societal issues, and cope with remarkable resilience during the COVID-19 world-wide pandemic. What this has taught us is that while we cannot predict all that the future will hold, we can be alert to opportunity, and understand our role as a value-added institution. We can be cognizant of programs, plans and policies that assumed an identity-neutral stance, and work towards better understanding how our individual and collective identities impact our ability to benefit from such programs. We have become wiser about our assessment methods and about how we track outcomes. We focus on continuous improvement and know that we will always be building towards a better Brockport.\\nWe are proudly part of the SUNY system. As SUNY changes, so do we change, though we stay true to our goals, our mission, our vision and our promise.\\nI want to thank the current Strategic Planning Committee\\n[1]\\nfor their hard work in consulting widely, listening to feedback, and revising the 2017-2022 plan with such diligence and care. We have adjusted our four goals, reduced our measures of success to 18, and, based on the overwhelming support by our community, added the value of Inclusion to our four existing values.

This may make it necessary to postpone completion of general education knowledge area courses until the sophomore or junior academic year.\\nStudents planning to apply for admission to a post-bachelor’s Health Professions program can contact Dr. Logan during their first few weeks on campus so that they can receive timely information and notices of meetings and events for students whose ambition is one of these health professions. Alternatively, students in GEP100 sections that contain Biology, Chemistry, and Biochemistry freshman will receive information about the program there.\\n- Assumes health professional school admission test date and application process at end of 6th semester, but many other options are possible for the timing of application. Please contact Dr. Cook or Dr. Logan if taking both CHM 205 and BIO 201 the first semester of the freshman year could pose a challenge to any individual student, and an alternative schedule is needed.\\nRequired Courses in the Freshman Year\\nNOTE: BIO 201 and BIO 202 are sequential and must be taken in order.\\nNOTE: Minimum grades of “C” in CHM 205 and CHM 206 are required before students are allowed to take further chemistry courses in the major.\\nRequired Courses in the Sophomore Year\\n* Students should discuss with their advisors whether one of these sequences should be deferred to the following year.\\nFurther Recommendations\\nFor additional information on achieving your professional goals, consult with your chemistry major advisor and pre-health advisor.', metadata={'source': 'https://www2.brockport.edu/academics/advisement/handbook/pre-health-chemistry', 'row': 224}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='url: https://www2.brockport.edu/academics/advisement/handbook/pre-law\\ndata: Pre-Law\\nThe Undergraduate Program\\nThe pre-law program at SUNY Brockport is not a degree-granting major. We have made a conscious decision not to institute a major in pre-law for several reasons. The most important is that in our discussions with Deans of Admissions from various law schools we have learned that law schools do not want students to major in pre- law. Not unreasonably, law schools believe that teaching students about the law is a job best done by the law schools themselves. What law schools do want is for student to major in fields that stress reading comprehension, analytical skills, logic, critical thinking, and writing and oral communication. Nearly every major at SUNY Brockport will provide exactly that kind of instruction. In addition, SUNY Brockport believes that you should have the flexibility of choosing any major that excites you as you prepare for law school. Students perform better when they major in fields that interest them and maintaining a high grade point average is key to getting into the law school of your choice.\\nWhat the pre-law program at SUNY Brockport does is introduce students to law, the legal profession, and help develop key foundation skills, enabling them to make a more informed choice about a legal career. In addition, the program helps students prepare so they have a better chance of being accepted into law school and of succeeding in their legal studies and career.\\nRecommended Courses\\n- PLS 320 Introduction to Legal Studies\\n- PLS 324 Constitutional Law I\\n- PLS 326 Constitutional Law II\\n- PLS 320 Law and Legal Process\\n- PLS 490 Moot Court Seminar\\n- CRJ 305 Adjudication Process\\n- CRJ 311 Criminal Law\\n- CRJ 455 Legal Traditions\\n- CRJ 475 Legal and Justice Research Methods\\n- CRJ 495 Law and Evidence\\n- BUS 375 Business Law I\\n- BUS 376 Business Law II\\n- ENL 305 Advanced Composition\\n- PHL 104 Critical Thinking\\n- PHL 202 Logic (This class will help sharpen critical thinking and writing skills, which are essential for law students and lawyers)\\nLegal Internship: Every student in the pre-law program will participate in a legal internship program. This experiential requirement is designed to insure that students gain insights into the practice of law. Before committing yourself to law school you should have a realistic understanding of the requirements of a legal practice.\\nCo-curriculum Activities\\nSUNY Brockport negotiated a special reduced-cost fee with Kaplan for our students. In addition, the Provost and Dean of Letters and Sciences have each agreed to rebate $100 dollars to students who take the Kaplan class and meet certain requirements. This campus-wide effort to ensure that students are able to afford preparatory classes is evidence of the deep commitment of SUNY Brockport to insure that those of our students who wish to go to law school are able to do so.\\nLaw Related Social Activities\\nThe pre-law social activities include events such as our annual Law Day celebration. Although events vary from year to year, a typical Law Day includes visits from Brockport alumni who are currently practicing attorneys and others who are in law school. We have also had panels with Deans of admissions from various law schools and representatives from the many law offices where we place interns. Other social activities include our new “Court TV in the Dorms” nights in which professors and students get together to view an episode of Court TV and discuss the proceedings. We also have an active pre-law club run by students.\\nCampus Pre-Law Advisor\\nSUNY Brockport has a campus Pre-Law Advisor who will be available to assist you throughout your entire undergraduate experience. If you plan to visit school and would like to set up a meeting with the pre law advisor send an email to Dr. Chadsey at mchadsey@brockport.edu, or contact me at (585) 395-2320. Check out our pre- law web site here.You should feel very confident that in choosing SUNY Brockport you are selecting a university that will do an exceptional job of preparing you for law school.', metadata={'source': 'https://www2.brockport.edu/academics/advisement/handbook/pre-law', 'row': 261}),\n",

These pages should help you better navigate the process at Brockport.\\n- Transfer EOP students must have been EOP/HEOP, SEEK, or College Discovery Program at their previous or current college. If you are an applicant who was previously in one of these programs and looking to be considered EOP at Brockport, you must check the EOP question on the SUNY or Common Application and submit the EOP Certificate of Eligibility Form.\\nThe Application Process\\nThe EOP application process is a very detailed one, and we encourage applicants to stay abreast of what the University is requesting at all times.\\nPhase 1: Academic Eligibility\\nApplicants to the program will be reviewed to determine if they are academically eligible. Meeting our minimum academic requirements allows you to be considered for further review. This does not, however, guarantee automatic eligibility for the program.\\nApplicants also need to complete the EOP Financial Eligibility process. An incomplete or unsubmitted form will delay the process.\\nPhase 2: Financial Eligibility\\nThis phase determines the applicant’s financial eligibility by taking into account the income received by each household member. Learn more about the Financial Review Process.\\nPlease submit the EOP Financial Form using the appropriate application link:\\nEOP Form for SUNY Application Users EOP Form for Common Application Users\\nWe have a limited number of seats for the program and review thousands of applications yearly; therefore, it is not possible to admit every single student into this program. Students who are accepted are encouraged to submit their deposit by the May 1 deadline. Once the program is filled, a waitlist will be created. To be placed on the waitlist, you will need to submit a deposit. That deposit will not be posted unless you are officially placed in the program. If we are unable to offer you a place in the program, your deposit will be refunded to you after the summer program begins.\\nRequired Documents\\nIn order for a final decision to be made on your application, you must submit ALL requested information. Documents can be faxed to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. They will be used to process your application.

Please rest assured that we are here to help. Our expert EOP admissions advisors are here to assist you throughout the process and ensure that you submit the proper documentation. However, we will also rely on you to submit the required documents in a timely manner.\\nPlease note that the EOP office will be an active part of this process, and you may be contacted by counselors regarding documents you are missing.

It is evident that the theme of sustainability will look different across departments, which supports the notion that not just one group of individuals can solve the major global crisis of living a more sustainable life. For this reason, we welcome the opportunity to present your unique relationship to this topic through the lens of your discipline and scholarly activity.\\nNote: All presentations and poster presentations do not have to incorporate this theme as we understand this might not be applicable for all, and we strongly encourage all presentations to be involved in this incredible event to showcase our campus community’s research and scholarly activity.\\nScholars Day presentations begin at 9 am and continue until 5 pm on the main Brockport campus.
