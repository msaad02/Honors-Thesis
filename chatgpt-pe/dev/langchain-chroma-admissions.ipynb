Atleast from the chunk_from_html.csv it is apparent that there are a lot of duplicates! some of the webpages I will need to filter out, so that semantic search doesn't return copies. My initial filter (code below) cut down everything by about half! I need to look at this closer. However, after removing it, results seem to be much improved.
